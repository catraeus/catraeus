I am Catraeus.
Music, Audio, Small Systems


I've been a developer for so long that I got an EE degree because CS degrees hadn't been thought of yet at my university!  My thesis in 1979 was "A Computer Aided Analysis of Music" and The University of Virginia had an ARP 2500 in the basement.  My thesis advisor thought the work wouldn't be of any use and was half baked.  Now there are parsers to analyze wavefile Audio and produce MIDI ... so much for Academia.  So, I guess I've been an electronic musician for a long time too.

I use QTractor for sequencing, zynsubaddfx/zyn-Fusion and fluidsynth/QSynth.  All this on Jack.

I chose the name catraeus because it sounds cool and in 2002 when I was setting up, google had zero returns for the name.  It still stays out of the way of everything.  There is an audio IC company called THAT ... imagine how many false results that comes up with.

Warm Regards
